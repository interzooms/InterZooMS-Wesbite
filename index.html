											<p>ZooMS blind test and positive control project
</p>
										</header>
										<p>This project is an international collaboration aimed at overcoming several challenges in the ZooMS (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry) research field, which are often beyond quantification within a single laboratory. This project is designed to understand and quantify the variability that one should anticipate when submitting a hypothetical sample to a hypothetical laboratory. Our aim is not to certify the workflow of any participating laboratory but rather to give participants the opportunity to see how their methodologies may differ from other laboratories and how that impacts their downstream results.

												<h3><strong>Step 1:</strong> Register your interest</h3>
												<p>Contact the <a href="mailto:interzooms.labexchange@gmail.com">experiment organisers</a>. Each participating laboratory will be given a unique identification code. This code will only be shared with the laboratory that is assigned the code and the organisers of the experiment. All resulting data will be published under these codes, allowing laboratories to anonymously share their data.</p>

											<div class="content">
												<h3><strong>Step 2:</strong> Samples are mailed to your laboratory</h3>
												<p>Participants will receive seven samples with the approximate age and brief taphonomic information for each. Participants may choose the protocol for the analysis of each sample but we request that the complete details of the chosen protocol is provided to us once it is completed. </p>

											<span class="icon solid fa-rocket"></span>
											<div class="content">
												<h3><strong>Step 3: </strong>Analyse the samples</h3>
												<p>Participants are required to analyse the samples, including mass spectrometry measurement, and send the data back to us. Data should be supplied in as raw of a format as possible. Preferably, directly from the mass spectrometer without averaging or other corrections applied. We will convert all of the data to an open-source format once we have received it. </p>

											<div class="content">
												<h3><strong>Step 4:</strong> Access your data </h3>
												<p>The organisers will upload all of the data into an open-access repository for participants to view. We will also publish the code used to convert the data. Data will be published under the identification codes supplied to participants at the beginning of this project to ensure it remains anonymised to everyone except the submitter.

												<h3><strong>Step 5:</strong> Publication </h3>
												<p>We would like to include this data in a manuscript, outlining the results of this first inter-laboratory ZooMS blind test. Authorship will be restricted to the experiment organisers but we will publish a list of participating organisations in the manuscript. If for whatever reason you would prefer not to have your data included in the manuscript, please let the organisers know. You are still more than welcome to participate in the experiment.</p>

												<h3><strong>Step 6:</strong> Positive control </h3>
												<p>One of the modern samples has been sourced in a large enough quantity that we can supply it to all participating institutions as a standard/positive control. At the conclusion of this first blind-test we will have fantastic comparative data to assess the potential of this sample as a positive control. We will keep you updated on this after the conclusion of the first round of analysis.
